# Ledger Calculation Verification

## Expected Customer Ledger Flow:

1. **Opening Balance**: 4000.00 DEBIT
   - Customer owes: 4000.00

2. **Sales**: 
   - MLX-001: 9500.00 DEBIT
   - MLX-002: 400.00 DEBIT  
   - MLX-003: 1100.00 DEBIT
   - Total sales: 11000.00
   - Customer owes: 4000 + 11000 = 15000.00

3. **Sale Return**: 340.00 CREDIT
   - Customer owes: 15000 - 340 = 14660.00

4. **Opening Balance Payments**:
   - Payment 1: 660.00 CREDIT
   - Payment 2: 340.00 CREDIT
   - Total payments: 1000.00
   - Customer owes: 14660 - 1000 = 13660.00

5. **Return Payment**: 340.00 DEBIT (FIXED)
   - When we pay customer cash for return, it should be DEBIT
   - Customer owes: 13660 + 340 = 14000.00

## Final Expected Balance: 14000.00

## Key Fixes Applied:

### 1. Return Payment Logic (Fixed)
**Before**: Return payments were CREDIT (reducing customer debt twice)
**After**: Return payments are DEBIT (offsetting the return credit)

**Logic**: 
- Sale return: 340 CREDIT (customer owes less)
- Return payment: 340 DEBIT (we give cash, customer owes more)
- Net effect: 0 (as it should be)

### 2. Opening Balance Payment Logic (Already Correct)
- Opening balance payments create payment entries only
- They don't modify the historical opening balance entry
- This is working correctly

### 3. Payment Detection Logic
**Updated**: Return payments detected by checking if notes contain "return"
**UnifiedLedgerService**: Returns payment notes include "Return payment - "

## Testing:
After applying these fixes:
1. Return payments should appear as DEBIT entries
2. Final customer balance should be 14000.00
3. Opening balance history should remain unchanged
4. Only payment entries should be created for opening balance payments
