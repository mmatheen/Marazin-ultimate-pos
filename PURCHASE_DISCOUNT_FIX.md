# PURCHASE DISCOUNT FIX - SUMMARY

## Changes Made:

### 1. Database Migration
- Created: `2025_10_22_000001_add_discount_fields_to_purchase_products_table.php`
- Added columns to `purchase_products` table:
  - `price` DECIMAL(15,2) - Original price before discount
  - `discount_percent` DECIMAL(5,2) - Product-level discount percentage (0-100)

### 2. Controller Updates (PurchaseController.php)
- Added validation rules for:
  - `products.*.price` (nullable, numeric, min:0)
  - `products.*.discount_percent` (nullable, numeric, min:0, max:100)

- Updated `processProducts()` method line ~242:
  - Now saves `price` and `discount_percent` when updating existing products

- Updated `addNewProductToPurchase()` method line ~407:
  - Now saves `price` and `discount_percent` when creating new products

### 3. JavaScript Updates (purchase_ajax.blade.php)
- Updated `processPurchase()` function line ~1175:
  - Now sends `price` (original price before discount)
  - Now sends `discount_percent` (percentage discount applied)
  - Removed duplicate `price` field that was sent twice

## How It Works Now:

1. **Frontend Calculation:**
   - User enters original price in "Unit Cost (Before Discount)" column
   - User enters discount percentage in "Discount Percent" column
   - JavaScript calculates: `unit_cost = price - (price * discount_percent / 100)`
   - Subtotal = `unit_cost * quantity`

2. **Data Sent to Server:**
   ```javascript
   products[0][price] = 175.00           // Original price
   products[0][discount_percent] = 10    // 10% discount
   products[0][unit_cost] = 157.50       // After discount
   products[0][total] = 315.00           // unit_cost * quantity (2)
   ```

3. **Database Storage:**
   - `purchase_products.price` = 175.00
   - `purchase_products.discount_percent` = 10
   - `purchase_products.unit_cost` = 157.50
   - `purchase_products.total` = 315.00

4. **Benefits:**
   - Can now see what discount was applied to each product
   - Can recalculate totals if needed
   - Audit trail of pricing changes
   - When editing purchase, discount information is preserved

## Testing:

1. Create a new purchase with product-level discounts
2. Check database to verify price and discount_percent are saved
3. Edit the purchase to verify discount values are loaded correctly
4. Verify total calculations are accurate

## Example Query to Check:

```sql
SELECT 
    pp.id,
    p.product_name,
    pp.quantity,
    pp.price as original_price,
    pp.discount_percent,
    pp.unit_cost as final_unit_cost,
    pp.total,
    ROUND(pp.price * pp.discount_percent / 100, 2) as discount_amount
FROM purchase_products pp
JOIN products p ON p.id = pp.product_id
WHERE pp.purchase_id = 1;
```

This will show:
- Original price before discount
- Discount percentage applied
- Final unit cost after discount
- Total for that product line
- Calculated discount amount for verification
