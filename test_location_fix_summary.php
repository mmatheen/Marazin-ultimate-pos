echo "🔧 SalesRepController Location Access Fix Summary\n";
echo str_repeat("=", 60) . "\n\n";

echo "✅ PROBLEM FIXED:\n";
echo "The error 'User does not have access to one or more selected locations' \n";
echo "has been resolved with a comprehensive solution.\n\n";

echo "🛡️ SECURITY FEATURES:\n";
echo "1. Role Validation: Only users with 'sales rep' role can be assigned\n";
echo "2. Permission Checking: Auto-assignment only by admin/manager users\n";
echo "3. Location Validation: Only sub-locations (with parent_id) are allowed\n";
echo "4. Duplicate Prevention: Existing active assignments are skipped\n";
echo "5. Audit Logging: All auto-assignments are logged for accountability\n\n";

echo "🚀 NEW FEATURES:\n";
echo "1. Auto-Assignment: Admin/Manager can assign users to new locations automatically\n";
echo "2. Parent Location Sync: Parent locations are also assigned for consistency\n";
echo "3. Detailed Response: Comprehensive feedback on all operations\n";
echo "4. Manual Assignment API: New endpoint for explicit location assignments\n";
echo "5. Enhanced Error Handling: Better error messages and validation\n\n";

echo "📋 HOW IT WORKS:\n";
echo "SCENARIO 1 - User HAS location access:\n";
echo "  → Assignment proceeds normally\n\n";
echo "SCENARIO 2 - User LACKS location access + Current user is Admin/Manager:\n";
echo "  → User is automatically assigned to the required location(s)\n";
echo "  → Assignment proceeds with success message\n";
echo "  → Action is logged for audit purposes\n\n";
echo "SCENARIO 3 - User LACKS location access + Current user is NOT Admin/Manager:\n";
echo "  → Assignment fails with clear error message\n";
echo "  → No changes are made to database\n\n";

echo "📡 NEW ENDPOINTS:\n";
echo "POST /api/sales-reps/assign-locations\n";
echo "  └─ Manually assign users to locations (Admin/Manager only)\n\n";

echo "🔍 VALIDATION IMPROVEMENTS:\n";
echo "• Checks user exists and has sales rep role\n";
echo "• Validates all locations are sub-locations\n";
echo "• Prevents assignments to non-sales rep users\n";
echo "• Maintains data integrity with transactions\n\n";

echo "📊 ENHANCED RESPONSE FORMAT:\n";
echo "{\n";
echo '  "status": true,' . "\n";
echo '  "message": "3 assignment(s) created successfully. User was automatically assigned to 2 new location(s).",' . "\n";
echo '  "data": [...assignments...],' . "\n";
echo '  "created_count": 3,' . "\n";
echo '  "duplicate_count": 0,' . "\n";
echo '  "error_count": 0,' . "\n";
echo '  "auto_assigned_locations": 2' . "\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "🎯 BENEFITS:\n";
echo "• No more location access errors for admins\n";
echo "• Streamlined sales rep assignment process\n";
echo "• Maintains security while improving usability\n";
echo "• Comprehensive audit trail\n";
echo "• Better user experience with clear feedback\n\n";

echo "The system now intelligently handles location assignments while\n";
echo "maintaining security and providing administrators with the flexibility\n";
echo "they need to efficiently manage sales representative assignments! 🎉\n";
