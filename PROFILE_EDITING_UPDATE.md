# Updated Role Security Implementation

## New Feature: Self-Profile Editing

The system has been updated to allow Super Admin and Master Super Admin users to edit their own profile details while maintaining strict security controls.

## What Super Admin and Master Super Admin Can Now Do:

### ✅ **Allowed Profile Updates:**
- **Full Name**: Can update their display name
- **Email**: Can change their email address  
- **Password**: Can change their password
- **Username**: Can modify their username
- **Name Title**: Can update their title (Mr, Ms, etc.)
- **Locations**: Can update their assigned locations

### ❌ **Restricted Operations:**
- **Role Change**: Cannot change their own role (Super Admin cannot make themselves Master Admin, etc.)
- **Account Deletion**: Cannot delete their own account
- **Role Assignment**: Cannot assign roles they don't possess to others

## Implementation Details:

### 1. **UserController Updates**

**Edit Method (`edit()`):**
- Now allows Super Admin and Master Admin to access their own profile edit form
- Returns additional fields `is_own_profile` and `can_edit_role` to help frontend determine permissions
- Maintains restrictions for other users editing Master Admin profiles

**Update Method (`update()`):**
- Validates role change attempts for own profile
- Allows profile updates (name, email, password, locations) for own account
- Prevents role changes with clear error message: "You cannot change your own role. Please contact another administrator to modify your role."
- Makes role field optional for own profile updates
- Provides different success messages for own profile vs other user updates

### 2. **Middleware Updates**

**RoleSecurityMiddleware:**
- Distinguishes between profile editing and administrative operations
- Allows GET requests for own profile access
- Validates role change attempts in POST/PUT/PATCH requests
- Maintains self-deletion prevention
- Provides specific error messages for different violation types

### 3. **Enhanced Security Logic**

**Role Change Detection:**
```php
$currentRole = $user->roles->first()?->name;
$isChangingOwnRole = $isOwnProfile && $request->roles && $request->roles !== $currentRole;
```

**Profile vs Administrative Operations:**
- Profile operations: name, email, password, locations
- Administrative operations: role assignments, user deletion
- Clear separation of allowed vs restricted operations

## Security Benefits:

1. **Improved Usability**: Super Admin and Master Admin can maintain their own profiles
2. **Maintained Security**: Role hierarchy and permissions remain intact
3. **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged and trackable
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Users understand what they can and cannot modify
5. **Prevents Lockouts**: Role changes still require another administrator

## Error Messages:

- **Role Change Attempt**: "You cannot change your own role. Please contact another administrator to modify your role."
- **Self Deletion**: "You cannot delete your own account."
- **Unauthorized Access**: "Access denied. Insufficient permissions for this user."

## Frontend Integration:

The edit endpoint now returns:
```json
{
    "is_own_profile": true/false,
    "can_edit_role": true/false
}
```

This allows the frontend to:
- Hide/disable role selection dropdown for own profile
- Show appropriate UI elements based on permissions
- Display different form layouts for self vs other user editing

## Testing Scenarios:

1. **Super Admin editing own profile**: ✅ Can edit name, email, password, locations
2. **Super Admin changing own role**: ❌ Blocked with error message
3. **Super Admin editing other users**: ✅ Full access (except Master Admin users)
4. **Master Admin editing own profile**: ✅ Can edit name, email, password, locations  
5. **Master Admin changing own role**: ❌ Blocked with error message
6. **Regular users**: ❌ Cannot access Super/Master Admin profiles

## Backward Compatibility:

- All existing functionality remains intact
- No breaking changes to API responses
- Additional fields in responses are optional for frontend consumption
- Previous security restrictions still enforced

This implementation provides the perfect balance between usability and security, allowing administrators to maintain their profiles while preventing privilege escalation and maintaining system integrity.
