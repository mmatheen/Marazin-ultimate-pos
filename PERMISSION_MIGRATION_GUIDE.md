# Complete Permission Migration System

## Overview
This Laravel Artisan command provides a comprehensive, production-safe solution for migrating permission structures in your POS system. It ensures that existing user assignments are preserved while updating the permission system to the latest structure.

## Features

### 🔒 Production-Safe Migration
- Complete backup of current permissions before any changes
- Transaction-based rollback on failures
- Dry-run mode for testing without making changes
- Preservation of existing user-role assignments

### 📊 Comprehensive Coverage
- Migrates ALL permissions (not just expenses)
- Handles multiple role types: Super Admin, Manager, Cashier, Sales Rep, Accountant, Staff
- Updates permission structure from RolesAndPermissionsSeeder
- Identifies and reports orphaned permissions

### 🛡️ Safety Features
- Rollback mechanism if migration fails
- Detailed logging and progress reporting
- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Backup restoration capabilities

## Usage

### Basic Migration
```bash
# Run the complete migration
php artisan permissions:migrate-all

# Test migration without making changes (recommended first)
php artisan permissions:migrate-all --dry-run

# Force migration without confirmations (use carefully)
php artisan permissions:migrate-all --force

# Create backup before migration
php artisan permissions:migrate-all --backup
```

### Command Options
- `--dry-run`: Test the migration without making any changes
- `--force`: Skip confirmation prompts (use in automated deployments)

## Pre-Migration Checklist

### 1. Backup Your Database
```sql
-- Create full database backup
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

### 2. Test Environment First
```bash
# Always test in staging/development first
php artisan migrate:all-permissions --dry-run
```

### 3. Check Current Permissions
```bash
# Review current permission structure
php artisan permission:show
```

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis
The command analyzes your current system:
- Counts existing permissions and roles
- Identifies current role-permission assignments
- Checks for potential conflicts

### 2. Permission Structure Loading
- Loads complete permission structure from RolesAndPermissionsSeeder
- Creates any missing permissions
- Preserves existing permissions that are still valid

### 3. Role Permission Migration
Updates permissions for each role type:

#### Super Admin
- All permissions (full system access)

#### Manager
- User management, sales, products, expenses, reports
- Cannot manage other super admins

#### Cashier
- POS operations, sales, basic customer management
- View-only access to reports

#### Sales Representative
- Customer management, sales operations
- Limited product access

#### Accountant
- Financial operations, expense management, reports
- No user management access

#### Staff
- Basic operational permissions
- Limited access based on job function

### 4. Cleanup Operations
- Identifies orphaned permissions (no role/user assignments)
- Reports potentially unused permissions
- Optional cleanup of old permission structures

## Post-Migration Steps

### 1. Test User Access
```bash
# Log in with different user types and test functionality
# Verify all features work as expected
```

### 2. Clear Permission Cache
```bash
php artisan permission:cache-reset
php artisan cache:clear
```

### 3. Update Custom Role Assignments
- Review any custom roles you've created
- Manually assign new permissions as needed
- Test custom role functionality

```

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
1. Check the error message in the output
2. Verify your RolesAndPermissionsSeeder is up to date
3. Ensure database connectivity
4. Check for any foreign key constraint issues

### Permission Cache Issues
```bash
# Clear all permission caches
php artisan permission:cache-reset
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### Backup Restoration
If you need to restore from backup:
```bash
# The command creates detailed backups in storage/app/
# Find your backup directory and restore as needed
```

### Custom Permissions Not Working
1. Verify permissions exist: `php artisan permission:show`
2. Check role assignments
3. Clear caches
4. Review middleware and guard configurations

## Production Deployment

### Recommended Deployment Process
1. **Test in Staging**: Run with `--dry-run` first
2. **Schedule Maintenance**: Plan for brief downtime
3. **Database Backup**: Full backup before migration
4. **Run Migration**: Execute the command
5. **Test Critical Paths**: Verify key functionality
6. **Monitor**: Watch for any permission-related errors

### Automation in CI/CD
```yaml
# Example deployment step
- name: Migrate Permissions
  run: php artisan migrate:all-permissions --force
```

## Security Considerations

- Always backup before running in production
- Test permission changes thoroughly
- Monitor user access logs after migration
- Review any custom permission assignments
- Ensure proper role separation is maintained

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the command output for specific error messages
2. Review the backup files created during migration
3. Test in a development environment first
4. Verify your RolesAndPermissionsSeeder matches your needs

**⚠️ Important**: This command modifies your permission structure. Always test in a non-production environment first and ensure you have proper database backups.
