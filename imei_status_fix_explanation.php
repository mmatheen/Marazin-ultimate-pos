echo "=== TESTING IMEI STATUS FIX FOR SOLD IMEIS ===\n\n";

echo "🐛 IDENTIFIED BUG:\n";
echo "The system was counting ALL IMEIs (including sold ones) when calculating batch capacity.\n";
echo "This caused false 'insufficient capacity' errors even when batches had available space.\n\n";

echo "📊 YOUR SCENARIO:\n";
echo "Product ID: 18\n";
echo "Location ID: 1\n";
echo "Batch 34 (BA001):\n";
echo "- Total Quantity: 4\n";
echo "- Existing IMEIs: 5 (ALL with status 'sold')\n";
echo "- New IMEI to add: '12345678998745'\n\n";

echo "❌ OLD CALCULATION (BUGGY):\n";
echo "available_capacity = batch_qty - ALL_existing_imeis\n";
echo "available_capacity = 4 - 5 = -1\n";
echo "Result: 'Insufficient batch capacity' ERROR\n\n";

echo "✅ NEW CALCULATION (FIXED):\n";
echo "available_capacity = batch_qty - AVAILABLE_existing_imeis\n";
echo "available_capacity = 4 - 0 = 4\n";
echo "Result: SUCCESS - Can assign new IMEI\n\n";

echo "🔧 TECHNICAL FIX:\n";
echo "Changed IMEI counting query from:\n";
echo "  WHERE product_id = X AND batch_id = Y AND location_id = Z\n";
echo "To:\n";
echo "  WHERE product_id = X AND batch_id = Y AND location_id = Z AND status = 'available'\n\n";

echo "💡 LOGIC EXPLANATION:\n";
echo "- Sold IMEIs no longer consume batch capacity (they're gone from inventory)\n";
echo "- Only 'available' IMEIs consume batch capacity\n";
echo "- This allows proper reuse of batch space after sales\n\n";

echo "📋 EXISTING IMEIS IN YOUR BATCH 34:\n";
echo "| ID | IMEI          | Status | Consumes Capacity? |\n";
echo "|----|---------------|--------|-----------------|\n";
echo "| 1  | 123456        | sold   | ❌ NO             |\n";
echo "| 2  | 12333         | sold   | ❌ NO             |\n";
echo "| 3  | 1212          | sold   | ❌ NO             |\n";
echo "| 8  | 1234567891201 | sold   | ❌ NO             |\n";
echo "| 10 | 009           | sold   | ❌ NO             |\n\n";

echo "📈 BATCH CAPACITY ANALYSIS:\n";
echo "Total Batch Quantity: 4\n";
echo "Available IMEIs consuming capacity: 0\n";
echo "Sold IMEIs (not consuming capacity): 5\n";
echo "Available Capacity: 4 - 0 = 4 slots\n";
echo "✅ Can assign new IMEI: YES\n\n";

echo "🎯 EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX:\n";
echo "API Request:\n";
echo "{\n";
echo "  \"product_id\": 18,\n";
echo "  \"location_id\": 1,\n";
echo "  \"imeis\": [\"12345678998745\"]\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "Success Response:\n";
echo "{\n";
echo "  \"status\": 200,\n";
echo "  \"message\": \"IMEI numbers saved successfully\"\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "📦 DATABASE STATE AFTER SUCCESS:\n";
echo "imei_numbers table will have:\n";
echo "| ID | IMEI           | Batch | Status    | Consumes Capacity? |\n";
echo "|----|----------------|-------|-----------|------------------|\n";
echo "| 1  | 123456         | 34    | sold      | ❌ NO              |\n";
echo "| 2  | 12333          | 34    | sold      | ❌ NO              |\n";
echo "| 3  | 1212           | 34    | sold      | ❌ NO              |\n";
echo "| 8  | 1234567891201  | 34    | sold      | ❌ NO              |\n";
echo "| 10 | 009            | 34    | sold      | ❌ NO              |\n";
echo "| XX | 12345678998745 | 34    | available | ✅ YES (1/4)       |\n\n";

echo "🔄 REMAINING CAPACITY:\n";
echo "After adding new IMEI:\n";
echo "- Total capacity: 4\n";
echo "- Used by available IMEIs: 1\n";
echo "- Remaining capacity: 3\n";
echo "- Can add 3 more IMEIs to this batch\n\n";

echo "🌟 BENEFITS OF THE FIX:\n";
echo "✅ Proper inventory management\n";
echo "✅ Batch space reuse after sales\n";
echo "✅ Accurate capacity calculations\n";
echo "✅ No false capacity errors\n";
echo "✅ Better stock utilization\n\n";

echo "📚 FILES UPDATED:\n";
echo "1. app/Http/Controllers/Web/ProductController.php\n";
echo "   - getIntelligentBatchAssignments() method\n";
echo "   - getSimpleBatchAssignments() method\n";
echo "2. app/Http/Controllers/Api/ProductController.php\n";
echo "   - getIntelligentBatchAssignments() method\n\n";

echo "🚀 READY TO TEST:\n";
echo "Your Flutter app should now successfully assign IMEIs\n";
echo "even when batches have sold IMEIs!\n\n";
